### Dataset Description

This project uses the **Iris dataset** from the `scikit-learn` library. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, used for classification tasks. It contains **150 samples** of iris flowers from **three species**:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each sample has **four features** (all numeric):

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

The goal of this dataset is to **predict the species of an iris flower** based on these features.
